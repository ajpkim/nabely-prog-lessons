Practice working with JS's primitive data types and using the basic
'means of combination' to create more complex or processed data.

Notes:
- Write notes or questions in the file and we can review them
- Use 'let' when you are initializing a variable: `let mySpanishLevel = 1000`
- Be sure to fully comment/uncomment the correct portions of the file because you can only
  initialize a variable 1 time, meaning you cannot have multiples lines like: `let a = ...`
- Run code often to see what happens and reflect on whether it matches what you expected
- After you finish a problem you can comment out things like print statements from that problem
 */

/* Problem 1: Build a paragraph by combining several variables together.
Initialize separate variables for things like your name, age, hobbies, home, etc.
and then create a new `paragraph` variable that combines all of these in a cohesive
paragraph and prints it out to the console.


Note: Use the special character '\n' to add line-breaks in your paragraph
to make outputted display look nicer.

// Write your code here...

/* Problem 2: Write code to show that `smallNum` is or is not a factor
of the `bigNum`. "Factor" as in, 2 and 4 are both factors of 8 but
neither are factors of 9. 3 is a factor of 9. So basically, whether or
not the smaller number evenly divides the large number.

Think about how you would do it with normal numbers on a piece of
paper if you were explaining it to a young child. Then, translate this
process to JS by computing things, storing the results in variables,
and comparing the values of different variables or numbers.

let bigNum = 100
let smallNum = 7

/*
Problem 3: Calculate the average spanish level of the 3 students below
and then print out a summary message of the students that includes
information about about the the avg level, top student, and lowest
student in a single paragraph.
 */

let danielSpanishLevel = 9
let mattSpanishLevel = 5
let alexSpanishLevel = 10

// Write your code here...

/*
Problem 4: Review each sub-problem and predict what will happen when
you run it. Uncomment one sub-problem at a time and run the code to see what
happens. There's some new basic language syntax here to start learning.
